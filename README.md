DEVELOPMENT RESPECT TO PENDLE FINANCE PROTOCOL
Laying the foundation that most assets in cryptocurrency is vastly dependent on hype and active users/influencers towards the project or assets being developed or launched
When an asset has been divided into both the Principal Token (PT) and Yield Tokenization(YT) and the PT will be staked for a certain period of time which will increase.
You can buy the Rights to Ownership which serves as the Principal Token  at a lower price than an actual property.
When a user deposit or stake token on Pendle Finance, DeFi gives a yield-bearing position and the yield-bearing position can be split into YT and PT. Where FuelPetitionApp comes to play in the superb way that Pendle finance handles assets is that we create the app to serve as a hype-generating-platform to attract potential investors to engage in a particular DeFi position and earn either the YT or PT.  Whenever there's a staking or deposit on DeFi there's always a yield-bearing position allocated to the user at the point in time which can be split into two YT and PT, the feature that Pendle Finance offers to their users.
Leveraging on this amazing feature, whenever a user makes a deposit or stakes an assets and the DeFi assigns a yield-bearing position, then the FuelPetitionApp will serve as a platform where a user who stake a particular assets can use the FuelPetitionApp to increase the amount and influence of user and participants to a particular YT or PT. 

Here, where all available campaigns on FuelPetitionApp will be considered as an assets that a user has or needs other users to consider as a potential, more influential and more yielding assets if participated in it. This will provide a more efficient and profitable way for users to know and be aware of yields that can generate more in due time and the essential details that need to be known - such as: the duration of the assets yields/stake, campaign(assets staked yield)









This is a [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) project bootstrapped with [`create-fuels`](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuels-ts/tree/master/packages/create-fuels).

## Getting Started

1. Start the Fuel development server. This server will start a local Fuel node and provide hot-reloading for your smart contracts.

```bash
npm run fuels:dev
```

2. Start the Next.js development server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Deploying to Testnet

To learn how to deploy your Fuel dApp to the testnet, you can follow our [Deploying to Testnet](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/fuels-ts/creating-a-fuel-dapp/deploying-a-dapp-to-testnet/) guide.
